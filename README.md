# OOP244 NAA and ZAA Notes


## Workshop Zero
As a student in my class, you must familiarize yourself with GitHub so you can share your daily work with me for advice/help, collaboration and monitoring your progress. 

This is done using what I call Workshop Zero; through a series of videos instructing you on how to set up your computer to use GitHub effectively for collaboration.
 
Complete this workshop by July 10th.

Here are the Videos. The due date for [Workshop Zero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxB4x6RkylouixUhNXf0MuwccLriA0DGC) is Monday Jan 16th.

### Mac Users and Workshop Zero
Workshop Zero is designed for windows, as you are required to learn and work with visual studio as an advanced IDE.<br />
For Mac, either you have to do all the git commands through command line, or you need to install a Virtual Machine and then do the lab:
- [Install Fusion Vmware](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html) Fusion is free for students; click on ["Register Lisence for Personal Use"](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/web/vmware/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal) 
- [Install Windows 10 on Fusion VM](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-custom-virtual-machine-vmware-fusion/)

### Previous Workshops and work (done in first half of the semster)

Push all the codes you have done in first half of the semester into your repository on github.
